Spend Your Life
===============

This simple page/script visualizes what you spend your life on.

It asks you about the time you spend for your every-day activities (e.g., sleep, commute, etc) and then draws a diagram of your overall time spending.

Most people get surprised when they discover how much time they spend on meaningless or unnecessary stuff.

Motivation
----------

I hacked it on a napkin for the [Web site] (http://daoshifting.ru/wp/) of Daoshifting book authored by my wife. This book is about optimizing the quality of life and the time-spending calculator page is a nice add-on/illustration to it.

In fact, the calculator page has turned out to be the second most visited page of the Web site which was a bit of surprise.

Demo
----

You can try it by cloning the GitHub [repository] (https://github.com/lischenko/spend-your-life) and opening ````demo.html````. Another example is ````demo-lang-autoselect.html```` but it requres to be deployed on the web server.

You can also visit [Daoshifting.ru] (http://daoshifting.ru/wp/?page_id=24) but bear in mind that it may be not the most recent version.
